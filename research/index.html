  <h4>APPLES: Fast Distance-based Phylogenetic Placement</h4>
  <p> In this project, I developed an algorithm called APPLES, a distance-based method of phylogenetic
  placement that improves on ML by more than an order of magnitude in speed and
  memory and comes very close to ML in accuracy. APPLES has better accuracy
  than ML for placing on trees with thousands of species and can place on trees
  with a hundred thousands species where ML cannot run. Finally, APPLES can
  accurately identify samples without assembled sequences for the reference or
  the query using k-mer-based distances, a scenario that ML cannot handle.

  <h4>The Aquarium cloning workflows</h4>
  <p><a href="http://klavinslab.org/aquarium.html" target="_blank">Aquarium</a> is a smart laboratory operating system invented in the <a href="http://klavinslab.org" target="_blank">Klavins Lab</a> where researchers can specify how to manipulate items that stored in the inventory using protocols and workflows written in computer codes. Adapted from the standard molecular cloning workflows, I wrote a majority of the codes in Ruby implementing two core molecular cloning workflows: plasmid construction and yeast cloning. These workflows take and batch users' inputs to the workflow and semi-automatically schedule the entire cloning process from ordering primers to Sanger sequencing verifications, resulting a nearly effortless cloning process in Aquarium. This technology also led to the startup <a href="http://www.aquarium.bio/" target="_blank">Aquarium</a> where I work as an engineer to build out the 21st century laboratory operating system, enabling reproducible and transferable workflows in biology labs and more.<p>

  <h4>Frequency response for a synthetic auxin signaling pathway in yeast</h4>
  <p>I developed an experimental process in the <a href="http://klavinslab.org" target="_blank">Klavins Lab</a> to interrogate frequency response for a synthetic auxin signaling pathway in yeast. The approach was using a microfluidic device called <a href="http://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/life-science-research/cell-culture-systems/cellASIC-live-cell-analysis/microfluidic-plates/68eb.qB.wfkAAAFBWmVb3.sJ,nav" target="_blank">CellASIC</a> to grow the yeast cell, where one can control the system precisely with different frequencies of auxin inputs and observe using fluorescence microscopy over time. I wrote Matlab based software to do image processing on the time course fluorescence images, which resulted in quantified time-course fluorescence data on the cells. Using the data, I generated a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bode_plot" target="_blank">Bode plot</a> describing the frequency response of signaling pathway. The result showed that this pathway works as a low-pass filter.</p>
